Large:
  [ ] a custom UI ala Dribbble inspiration
  [ ] save in a DB and be able to share with others

Medium:
  [ ] save as in local storage under a slug key
  [ ] show price to rent ratio and be able to toggle it on/off like rent to income
  [ ] remove await from Chart and make sure we "cancel" old results if they arrive late

Small:
  [ ] show a diff from the previous state in the legend (like Simpletax)
  [ ] show the year/month in the legend
  [ ] flip animation on the legend not working

Nice to have:
  [ ] accept math equations as the input and use mathjs to parse
  [ ] parse dollar input values (like Wealthsimple, mathjs?)
  [ ] toggle a table view of results
  [ ] configure currency and locale
  [ ] tests on the core estimate logic

Extras:
  [ ] complex scenarios
  [ ] find a value to make lines equal at the end
  [ ] sensitivity analysis
  [ ] probability distribution

Future:
  [ ] switch the model to CoffeeScript?
  [ ] use Brilliant programming UI to build models?
