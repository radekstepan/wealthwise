- [ ] tests on the core estimate logic
- [ ] tooltips on each form field

- [ ] arrows describing the different sections
- [ ] review TODO notes

Nice to have
- [ ] fix <20% down on a >1mil property - show an alert or change the downpayment for the user and show warning
- [ ] legend doesn't flip, shows buyer, renter in that order always
- [ ] hide ditribution if there's none to show
- [ ] Cmd+C should copy an unformatted numeric value
- [ ] test if a new RNG seed is needed for each run
- [ ] flip animation on the legend not working
- [ ] simulate "x" years (needs to subtract mortgage in the table)
- [x] scenario for how much more expensive (in %) is the new property when moving - 1% pa
- [ ] extra cost when buying a new property
- [x] early prepayment simulation
- [x] download a spreadsheet of median result to "Check the result yourself"
- [x] when looking at net worth each year we apply sale costs to all years, but we move in some years which results in double counting of these fees
- [x] show in the chart when rent covers all costs and when principal is paid off
- [ ] for mortgage and rent covers lines, figure out if label should show left or right based on how much "distance" we have from edges of the chart. Or show a floating label.
- [ ] make the amounts vertical labels more human readable

Next
- [ ] show a read-only province (go with Alberta since it has no land transfer tax); https://www.truenorthmortgage.ca/tools/land-transfer-tax-calculator
  - add British Columbia and Ontario to the list of provinces
  - first time homebuyer checkbox
  - render provinces as a dropdown
    - do the same for other booleans
