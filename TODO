Large:

  [ ] show monthly expenses in buy vs rent
  [x] add catastrophic loss event (house value) @medium

  [ ] parse dollar input values (like Wealthsimple, mathjs?)
  [ ] toggle a table view of results
  [ ] configure currency and locale
  [ ] tests on the core estimate logic

Extras:
  [ ] complex scenarios
  [ ] find a value to make lines equal at the end
